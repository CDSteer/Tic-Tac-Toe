This is the classic game of tic-tac-toe I made while leaning jquery. 

I have made it as as part of my Event Driven Programing class in college.

How to play:

Player 1 is X and take the first turn.
Player 2 is O and takes the second turn.

Repeat untill 3 in a row match or no moves can be taken. 

The new game button resets the board.
