This is the classic game of tic-tac-toe I made while learning jquery. 

I have made it as part of my Event Driven Programing class in college.

The game can be played at http://10088752.cgosh.co.uk/game/

How to play:

Player 1 is X and takes the first turn.
Player 2 is O and takes the second turn.

Repeat until 3 in a row match is reached or no moves can be taken. 

The new game button resets the board.
